# Tomodachi Revolution Dialog

This repository houses dialog for Tomodachi Revolution.




## Usage/Examples

When making dialog, go to the .JSON file you want to add to, and create a fork / pull request. Then, after editing the files you want, submit your pull request and the staff team will review it. If any corrections are needed, correct them. If you are denied for any specific reasons, correct them. Staff have a final say over what gets added to the game.




## FAQ

#### Is there a limit to how much I can submit?

While there isn't *technically* a limit, please refrain from modifying more than one file per PR.

#### What if I get denied?

Make any corrections listed, write different dialog, or refrain from submitting again depending on the response.

#### What if I want credit for my lines?

Your name can be listed in a credits section of the game. You can choose to use your real name, or an online ID. Please refrain from using non alphanumeric names, with the exception of common things like ```!```.
